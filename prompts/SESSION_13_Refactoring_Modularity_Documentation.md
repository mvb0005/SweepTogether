# Session 13: Refactoring for Modularity and Documentation

**NOTE: The original prompt for this session is not available.**

## Session Notes

In this session, we refactored the codebase for better modularity and improved documentation, applying software engineering best practices.

### Backend Refactoring

- Created modular TypeScript files:
  - `types.ts`: Moved all shared interfaces and types with detailed TSDoc comments
  - `board.ts`: Extracted board creation and management functions
  - `game.ts`: Moved core game logic including flood fill, reveal actions, and win condition checking
  - `socketHandlers.ts`: Separated WebSocket event handlers and communication logic
  - `server.ts`: Simplified as the entry point that sets up Express and Socket.IO
- Added thorough TSDoc comments to all functions and interfaces
- Fixed a bug in the game over message format (added "Game Over!" prefix to mine hit messages)

### Frontend Restructuring

- Restructured to use ES modules for better organization:
  - `ui.js`: DOM manipulation and rendering functions
  - `network.js`: WebSocket communication layer
  - `gameClient.js`: Game state management and logic
  - `main.js`: Entry point that initializes the game
- Updated `index.html` to use modules with `type="module"`
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments throughout the frontend code

### Benefits

- Better separation of concerns
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Enhanced documentation for future development
- Easier identification and resolution of bugs

This refactoring significantly improved the codebase structure, making it more maintainable and easier for new developers to understand.
