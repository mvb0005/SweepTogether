# Session 24: Implement ScoreService

## Original Prompt

Adopt the Backend Developer persona from `/mnt/c/Users/mvb/code/Mines/agent_personas/backend_developer.md`.

**Context:** Review `/mnt/c/Users/mvb/code/Mines/AGENT_CONTEXT.md` and `/mnt/c/Users/mvb/code/Mines/SESSION_GUIDELINES.md`, focusing on sections related to architecture, key files, and testing guidelines. In previous sessions, we've completed the `PlayerActionService` implementation with all three core player actions (reveal tile, flag tile, and chord click). Now we need to implement the `ScoreService` to properly manage player scores across the game.

**Background:** The game's scoring system rewards players for revealing cells and flagging mines correctly, while penalizing them for hitting mines. Currently, score updates happen directly in the PlayerActionService, but we need a dedicated service to centralize score management, calculation, and distribution of score-related events.

**Task:**
1. Create a new file `backend/src/application/scoreService.ts` to implement the `ScoreService` class
2. The service should:
   a. Subscribe to relevant events from the EventBus (e.g., tile reveals, flag placements, mine hits)
   b. Calculate score changes based on the game's scoring configuration
   c. Update player scores in the game state
   d. Broadcast score updates to clients through the GameUpdateService
   e. Support special scoring scenarios (e.g., bonuses for multiple reveals in a single action)
3. Extract any score calculation logic currently in PlayerActionService to the new ScoreService
4. Update PlayerActionService to use the new ScoreService instead of directly handling score updates

**Verification:**
1. Create a new test file at `backend/src/tests/unit/scoreService.test.ts` to test the new functionality
2. Ensure tests cover:
   - Score calculation for different actions (reveal, flag, chord click)
   - Handling of score updates for multiple players
   - Interaction with GameUpdateService for broadcasting updates
   - Any special scoring rules or edge cases
3. Run the tests with coverage to ensure good test coverage of the new service
4. Update any existing tests that might be affected by the changes to PlayerActionService

**Context Update:** Add a summary of the implementation to `SESSIONS.md` when complete, noting any design decisions or patterns used in the ScoreService implementation.

## Session Notes

In this session, we implemented a dedicated ScoreService to centralize all scoring logic for the Minesweeper game. This refactoring significantly improved code organization by removing scoring responsibilities from the PlayerActionService.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Created ScoreService**: Implemented a dedicated service for handling all scoring operations with methods:
   - `handleCellReveal`: Awards points based on the number of cells revealed
   - `handleMineHit`: Applies penalty when a player hits a mine
   - `handleFlagToggle`: Manages points for placing or removing flags

2. **Integration with PlayerActionService**: Modified PlayerActionService to delegate all scoring responsibilities to ScoreService:
   - Updated the constructor to accept ScoreService as a dependency
   - Replaced direct score calculations with calls to appropriate ScoreService methods
   - This applied to all three player actions (reveal, flag, chord click)

3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 
   - Added unit tests for ScoreService achieving ~89% code coverage
   - Updated PlayerActionService tests to properly mock ScoreService
   - Fixed integration issues between services in the tests

### Design Decisions

1. **Service Dependency**: ScoreService requires GameStateService and GameUpdateService to:
   - Access game state and player information
   - Update player scores in the UI

2. **Consistent Score Messaging**: Implemented descriptive reason messages for score updates to improve player feedback:
   - "Cell Reveal" for regular reveals
   - "Mine Hit" for penalties
   - "Place Flag" / "Remove Flag" for flag actions

3. **Error Handling**: Added robust error handling for scenarios like:
   - Game or player not found
   - Invalid score parameters
   - Unexpected exceptions during score calculations

### Test Coverage

The implementation achieved excellent test coverage:
- ScoreService.ts: ~89% line coverage 
- PlayerActionService.ts: ~98% line coverage with the new integration

All tests are now passing, validating that the scoring system works correctly for all player actions.
