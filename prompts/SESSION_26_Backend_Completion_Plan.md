# Session 26: Backend Completion Plan

Date: May 2, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for completing the backend to a minimum usable level. It categorizes features into "must-have" components that are essential for basic functionality and "can-wait" components that can be implemented in future development phases.

## Current State Assessment

We have already implemented:

1. **Core Game Mechanics**
   - Board generation and management
   - Reveal tile functionality with flood fill
   - Flag placement and removal
   - Chord click functionality
   - Game over detection and board reveal

2. **Player and Scoring**
   - Player action service
   - Scoring system with configurable rules
   - Leaderboard service for tracking rankings

3. **Infrastructure**
   - MongoDB integration for persistence
   - Event-driven architecture with typed events
   - Basic Socket.IO event definitions
   - Testing framework with high coverage

## Must-Have Components

These components are critical for a minimally viable backend:

### 1. Complete Socket.IO Integration

- **Server Setup and Configuration**
  - Proper error handling for socket connections
  - Reconnection handling to maintain player state
  - Room management for multiplayer games
  
- **Event Handling**
  - Complete implementation of all defined socket events
  - Proper payload validation before processing
  - Consistent error reporting to clients

### 2. Game Lifecycle Management

- **Game Creation**
  - Endpoint to create new games with configurable settings
  - Generation of shareable game IDs
  - Initial state setup and persistence

- **Game Joining**
  - Mechanism for players to join existing games
  - Player identity management (username, ID)
  - Handling of reconnections to existing games

- **Game Cleanup**
  - Automatic cleanup of abandoned/finished games
  - Memory management for active games
  - Database archiving strategy

### 3. Core API Endpoints

- **RESTful Endpoints**
  - `GET /api/games/:id` - Get information about a specific game
  - `POST /api/games` - Create a new game
  - `GET /api/leaderboard` - Get leaderboard data

- **Documentation**
  - API documentation with request/response formats
  - Error codes and handling

### 4. Error Handling and Validation

- **Input Validation**
  - Consistent validation of all incoming requests
  - Proper error messages with actionable information
  
- **Error Responses**
  - Standardized error response format
  - Appropriate HTTP status codes
  - Logging of errors for troubleshooting

### 5. Session Management

- **Player Sessions**
  - Track active player sessions
  - Handle disconnections and reconnections
  - Clean up abandoned sessions

- **State Synchronization**
  - Ensure client and server state consistency
  - Recover from synchronization issues

### 6. Logging and Monitoring

- **Server Logging**
  - Request/response logging
  - Error logging with context
  - Performance metrics collection

- **Health Endpoints**
  - `GET /api/health` - Basic server health check
  - Database connectivity verification

## Can-Wait Components

These components are important but can be implemented in later development phases:

### 1. Advanced Security

- Authentication system with user accounts
- Authorization and role-based access
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Input sanitization beyond basic validation

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Database query optimization
- Connection pooling and resource management
- Load testing and scalability improvements

### 3. Advanced Game Features

- Spectator mode
- Game replays
- Custom game modes
- Tournament support

### 4. Administrative Features

- Admin dashboard for monitoring
- User management tools
- Game moderation capabilities
- System configuration interface

### 5. Analytics and Metrics

- Player performance tracking
- Usage analytics
- System performance metrics
- A/B testing framework

### 6. Advanced Error Recovery

- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Comprehensive backup and restore

## Implementation Plan

For Session 26, we should focus on implementing the following must-have components:

1. Complete the Socket.IO server setup and connection handling
2. Implement game creation and joining endpoints
3. Add session management for players
4. Establish standardized error handling
5. Set up basic logging and a health endpoint

This will provide a solid foundation that allows the frontend to connect and interact with the game, while still being manageable to implement in a single session.

## Success Criteria

The backend will be considered minimally usable when:

1. Players can create new games with custom settings
2. Players can join existing games via a game ID
3. All core game actions (reveal, flag, chord) work reliably
4. Game state persists between server restarts
5. Players can reconnect and continue playing
6. Basic error handling provides useful feedback
7. Leaderboards track and display player rankings
