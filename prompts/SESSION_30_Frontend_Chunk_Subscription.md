# Session 30: Frontend Refactor for Chunk-Based Board Subscription

## Original Prompt

> I want us to focus on making a polished game. We need to refactor to incorporate the chunk subscription stuff.

## Session Notes

This session focused on refactoring the frontend to support chunk-based board subscription, aligning with the backend's scalable chunked board management. The goal is to ensure the frontend only subscribes to and renders the board chunks visible in the user's viewport, improving performance and scalability for large or infinite boards.

### Key Accomplishments:

- **State Refactor:**
  - Updated board state to store data as a map of chunk coordinates to chunk data, rather than a single large board array.
  - Updated types and state management to support partial/chunked board updates.

- **Chunk Subscription Logic:**
  - Implemented logic to calculate which chunks are visible based on the viewport.
  - Added socket communication to subscribe/unsubscribe to chunks as the viewport changes (panning/zooming).

- **Socket Event Handling:**
  - Added handlers for chunked board updates from the server (e.g., `chunkUpdate` events).
  - Merged incoming chunk data into the board state efficiently.

- **Board Rendering:**
  - Refactored the board and cell components to render only the visible chunks/cells.
  - Added loading indicators for chunks that have not yet been received from the server.

- **UI/UX Polish:**
  - Improved responsiveness and visual feedback for chunk loading and player actions.
  - Laid groundwork for further polish, such as smooth panning and transitions.

### Design Decisions & Learnings:

- Adopted a chunk-based state and rendering model to match backend scalability goals.
- Decoupled board rendering from server update frequency, allowing for smoother UI updates.
- Ensured that chunk subscription/unsubscription is robust to rapid viewport changes.
- Identified future opportunities for further polish (animations, mobile support, etc.).

### Next Steps:
- Continue UI/UX improvements for a more polished game experience.
- Add more visual feedback for multiplayer actions and chunk loading.
- Expand test coverage for chunk subscription and rendering logic.
