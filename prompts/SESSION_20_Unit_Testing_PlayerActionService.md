# Session 20: Unit Testing PlayerActionService

**NOTE: The original prompt for this session is not available.**

## Session Notes

In this session, we created comprehensive unit tests for the `PlayerActionService.handleRevealTile` function, following up on our implementation in Session 19.

### Test Setup

- Created new test file at `backend/src/tests/unit/playerActionService.test.ts`
- Set up robust testing environment with appropriate mocks:
  - Mocked `EventBus.subscribe` to capture event handlers
  - Mocked `GameStateService` including `getGame`, `getCell`, `updateGridCell`, and `updateGridCells`
  - Mocked `GameUpdateService` for all notification methods
  - Created mock game state and player data

### Test Cases

- Basic case: Successfully revealing a non-mine cell
- Mine hit case: Revealing a mine with lockout, score deduction, and notifications
- Flood fill case: Revealing a cell with 0 adjacent mines
- Edge cases:
  - Already revealed cell (no action taken)
  - Locked out player (action blocked)
  - Expired lockout (player unlocked)
  - Non-existent game (error handled)
  - Non-existent player (gracefully handled)
  - Error during reveal call (error handled)

### Coverage Configuration

- Added coverage settings to `jest.config.js`
- Ran tests with coverage reporting (`--coverage` flag)
- Verified high coverage for `PlayerActionService`:
  - 93% statement coverage
  - 90% branch coverage

### Best Practices Implemented

- Structured tests with clear Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Isolated tests using proper mocking
- Added detailed test descriptions that explain what's being tested
- Verified proper function calls, parameters, and state updates
- Added comprehensive documentation to test file for future maintainability

### Outcome

Created a comprehensive test suite for `PlayerActionService.handleRevealTile` with excellent code coverage, verifying all core functionality and edge cases. Left `handleFlagTile` and `handleChordClick` for future test sessions as they haven't been fully implemented yet.
