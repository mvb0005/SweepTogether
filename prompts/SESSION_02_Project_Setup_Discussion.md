# Session 2: Project Setup Discussion

**NOTE: The original prompt for this session is not available.**

## Session Notes

In this session, we completed the initial project setup phase as outlined in the High-Level Plan (Step 1). This established the foundation for our development environment.

### Backend

- Initialized Node.js project (`backend/package.json`)
- Set up a basic Express server (`backend/server.js`)
- Integrated Socket.IO into the Express server
- Created `backend/Dockerfile` for containerizing the Node.js application

### Frontend

- Created basic HTML (`frontend/index.html`), CSS (`frontend/style.css`), and JavaScript (`frontend/script.js`) files
- Created `frontend/Dockerfile` using a simple static server (nginx) to serve the frontend files
- Added `frontend/nginx.conf` to proxy Socket.IO requests
- Updated `frontend/Dockerfile` to use the custom `nginx.conf`

### Database

- Defined a PostgreSQL service within `docker-compose.yml`, including volume for data persistence

### Containerization & Orchestration

- Configured `docker-compose.yml` to define and link the `backend`, `frontend`, and `db` services
- Ensured services can communicate over the Docker network
- Verified that `docker-compose up --build` successfully builds images and starts all containers
- Established basic connectivity between services (e.g., backend can theoretically connect to DB, frontend can be served)
