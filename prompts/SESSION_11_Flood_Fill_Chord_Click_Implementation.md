# Session 11: Flood Fill & Chord Click Implementation

**NOTE: The original prompt for this session is not available.**

## Session Notes

In this session, we implemented the "Flood Fill" and "Chord Click" core gameplay mechanics and added corresponding E2E tests.

### Backend (`backend/src/server.ts`) Implementation

#### Flood Fill
- Implemented the `floodFill` function to recursively reveal adjacent empty cells when a cell with 0 adjacent mines is revealed
- Integrated `floodFill` logic into the `revealTile` handler
- This ensures that when a player clicks on an empty cell, all connected empty cells and their bordering number cells are automatically revealed

#### Chord Click
- Implemented `handleChordClick` logic: When a revealed number cell is clicked and the number of adjacent flags matches the cell's number, reveal adjacent hidden, non-flagged cells
- Integrated `handleChordClick` logic into the `revealTile` handler
- Ensured both mechanics correctly handle game over conditions (e.g., chord click revealing a mine)
- Updated the `gameState` emission to include all newly revealed cells from these actions

### E2E Tests

- Created `cypress/e2e/flood_fill.cy.js` to test the flood fill behavior
- Created `cypress/e2e/chord_click.cy.js` to test the chord click behavior, including:
  - Success case (all adjacent cells revealed)
  - No-op case (number of flags doesn't match adjacent mines)
  - Game over scenario (chord click reveals a mine)
- Updated the E2E test list in `TODO.md`

### Documentation Updates

- Marked "Flood Fill" and "Chord Click" features as implemented in the "Core Gameplay Features" section of `TODO.md`
- Added the new E2E test files to the "E2E Tests" section

These implementations enhanced the gameplay with standard Minesweeper features that improve the user experience by reducing tedious clicks and adding strategic depth.
