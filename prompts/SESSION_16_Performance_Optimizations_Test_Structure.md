# Session 16: Performance Optimizations & Test Structure

**NOTE: The original prompt for this session is not available.**

## Session Notes

In this session, we improved performance of the infinite world generation and established a proper test directory structure.

### Performance Optimization

- Analyzed performance characteristics of the Simplex noise function used for mine placement
- Implemented caching strategies for both `isMine` and `getCellValue` functions:
  - Added Map-based caches with controlled size limits to prevent memory issues
  - Set up a FIFO eviction strategy for the caches when they exceed size thresholds
  - Implemented cache key generation based on coordinates

### Test Framework Restructuring

- Removed old test files from `backend/src/` directory
- Created proper test directory at `backend/tests/unit/`
- Implemented new tests for `worldGenerator` functions without relying on mocks
- Tests now use the deterministic nature of the seeded noise function

### Outcome

The worldGenerator functions now perform significantly better with caching, reducing redundant calculations. The test directory structure follows best practices and tests verify the actual behavior of the functions.
