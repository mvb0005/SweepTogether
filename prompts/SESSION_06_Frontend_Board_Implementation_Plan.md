# Session 6: Frontend Board Implementation Plan

**NOTE: The original prompt for this session is not available.**

## Session Notes

In this session, we developed a plan to implement the frontend rendering of the Minesweeper board based on detailed state received from the backend.

### Backend Changes Required

- Modify the `gameState` event emission in `backend/src/server.ts`
- Instead of sending a `boolean[][]` for `revealedBoard`, send a `Cell[][]` structure
- For revealed cells, send the full `Cell` object (`{ isMine, adjacentMines, revealed: true, flagged }`)
- For hidden cells, send a minimal representation like `{ revealed: false, flagged }` to avoid exposing mine locations prematurely

### Frontend Changes Required (`frontend/script.js`)

- Update the `socket.on('gameState', ...)` handler to expect the new `Cell[][]` structure in `state.revealedBoard` (or rename the key if needed, e.g., `boardState`)
- Modify the `renderBoard` function to:
  - Accept the `Cell[][]` structure as input
  - Iterate through the cells
  - For each cell:
    - If `cell.revealed` is `true`:
      - Add the `revealed` class
      - If `cell.isMine` is `true`, add `mine` class and display 'ðŸ’£'
      - If `cell.adjacentMines > 0`, add `mines-N` class and display the number
      - Otherwise (0 adjacent mines), leave the cell blank
    - If `cell.revealed` is `false`:
      - Add the `hidden` class
      - If `cell.flagged` is `true`, add `flagged` class and display 'ðŸš©'
  - Ensure click/contextmenu listeners are correctly attached and check the `revealed` status before emitting events

This plan established a clear path forward for enhancing the frontend rendering to properly display the game board with appropriate cell states and visuals.
