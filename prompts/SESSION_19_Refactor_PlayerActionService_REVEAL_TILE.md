# Session 19: Refactor PlayerActionService for REVEAL_TILE

**NOTE: The original prompt for this session is not available.**

## Session Notes

In this session, we refactored `PlayerActionService` to handle the `REVEAL_TILE` action using the new infinite world logic (`gridLogic.ts`, `gameStateService.ts`).

### Implementation Steps

- Created a minimal implementation of `GameUpdateService` for sending client updates:
  - Player status updates
  - Score updates
  - Tile updates
- Updated `PlayerActionService` to integrate with the infinite world logic:
  - Added proper handling of both mine hit cases and successful reveals
  - Integrated with `gridLogic.revealCell` and `gameStateService.getCell` for core logic
  - Implemented score calculations and player status updates
  - Used `gameStateService.updateGridCells`/`updateGridCell` to persist state in `SpatialHashGrid`
- Updated service wiring in `services.ts` to properly inject dependencies

### Key Design Decisions

- Used a separate `GameUpdateService` for client communication rather than publishing directly to the event bus
- Set up a clean separation of concerns:
  - `gridLogic.ts` for game rules
  - `gameStateService.ts` for state persistence
  - `GameUpdateService` for client notifications
- Left the `flagTile` and `chordClick` handlers for future sessions

### Outcome

The `REVEAL_TILE` action now works with the infinite world, handling both mine hits and successful reveals correctly. This establishes the pattern for subsequent actions to be implemented.
