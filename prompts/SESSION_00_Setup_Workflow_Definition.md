## Session Notes

In this session, we defined and set up the session-based workflow, context files, and personas to establish a structured approach for ongoing development.

### Workflow and Documentation Setup

- Created `AGENT_CONTEXT.md` detailing:
  - Project structure
  - Technology stack
  - Architecture
  - The new session-based workflow
- Created persona files in `agent_personas/` for specialized roles:
  - Backend Developer
  - Frontend Developer
  - Testing Expert
  - Persistence Expert
  - DevOps Engineer
  - Prompt Engineering Expert

### Code Restructuring

- Renamed `board.ts` -> `gridLogic.ts` and `board.test.ts` -> `gridLogic.test.ts`
- Updated `gameStateService.ts` to integrate `SpatialHashGrid` and `worldGenerator`
- Implemented `getCell` functionality
- Fixed unit tests for `gridLogic.ts`

### Outcome

The session established a solid foundation for future development with clearly defined roles, context, and a structured workflow. The codebase was prepared for structured sessions focusing on specific features and improvements.
