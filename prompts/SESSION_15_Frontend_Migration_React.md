# Session 15: Frontend Migration to React

**NOTE: The original prompt for this session is not available.**

## Session Notes

In this session, we replaced the vanilla JS frontend with a React application using Vite and TypeScript.

### Implementation Steps

- Initialized a new React project within the `frontend` directory using Vite
- Created a basic WebSocket connection hook (`useSocket`)
- Developed `Cell` and `Board` components to render the game grid
- Refactored `App.tsx` to manage game state (board, players, etc.) received via WebSocket
- Implemented handlers for `revealTile` and `flagTile` actions, sending events to the backend
- Configured Nginx (`nginx/nginx.conf`) to support SPA routing (e.g., `/game/{gameId}`)
- Updated `App.tsx` to extract `gameId` from the URL path
- Debugged and fixed the backend `handleJoinGame` function to emit the correct `gameJoined` event and payload structure expected by the React frontend

### Outcome

The frontend now renders the basic Minesweeper board using React, connects to the backend, and receives the initial game state. Basic interaction placeholders are present.

### Next Steps

- Add CSS styling
- Implement PlayerList and Leaderboard components
- Refine event handling
