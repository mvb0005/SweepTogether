# Session 23: Implement handleChordClick in PlayerActionService

## Original Prompt

Adopt the Backend Developer persona from `/mnt/c/Users/mvb/code/Mines/agent_personas/backend_developer.md`.

**Context:** Review `/mnt/c/Users/mvb/code/Mines/AGENT_CONTEXT.md`, focusing on sections 3 (Architecture), 4 (Key Files), and 7 (Testing Guidelines). In previous sessions, we've refactored the `PlayerActionService` to handle the `REVEAL_TILE` action (Session 19), created comprehensive tests for it (Session 20), and implemented `FLAG_TILE` functionality (Session 21). Now we need to implement the `CHORD_CLICK` action using the same patterns.

**Background:** Chord clicking is a common Minesweeper feature where, when clicking on a revealed numbered cell, if the number of adjacent flagged cells equals the cell's number, all remaining adjacent non-flagged cells are revealed. This can either reveal more safe cells or trigger a mine and cause game over.

**Task:**
1. Read the current implementation of `handleChordClick` in `backend/src/application/playerActionService.ts` (currently a TODO stub).
2. Read the relevant functions in `backend/src/domain/gridLogic.ts` (`chordClick`) and `backend/src/application/gameStateService.ts` (`getCell`, `updateGridCell`).
3. Implement the `handleChordClick` function in `playerActionService.ts`:
   a. Retrieve the `GameState` using `gameStateService`.
   b. Validate the game state and player status (reusing the `validateAction` helper method you created in Session 21).
   c. Call `chordClick` from `gridLogic.ts`, passing the `gameState`, coordinates, and `gameStateService.getCell`.
   d. Handle the result:
     - If a mine is hit (result has `hitMine` property), handle similarly to the mine hit case in `handleRevealTile`.
     - If cells were revealed (result is Cell[]), update the game state and calculate points for the newly revealed cells.
     - If the result is empty array or null, do nothing (no cells were revealed).
   e. Publish appropriate events through `gameUpdateService` (player status, score, and tile updates).

**Verification:**
1. After implementing `handleChordClick`, run unit tests to check for any compilation errors.
2. Create a new test file at `backend/src/tests/unit/playerActionService.chordClick.test.ts` to test the new functionality:
   a. Use the test structure from other PlayerActionService test files as a template.
   b. Include tests for:
      - Successfully chord clicking (revealing multiple adjacent cells)
      - Chord clicking that reveals a mine (game over scenario)
      - Chord clicking with insufficient flags (no action)
      - Edge cases (locked player, non-existent game, etc.)
   c. Run the tests with coverage to ensure good test coverage of the new functionality.

**Context Update:** Add a summary of the implementation to `SESSIONS.md` when complete, noting any challenges or optimizations in the implementation.

## Session Notes

In this session, we completed the implementation of the chord click functionality in the `PlayerActionService` to handle the third and final core player action in the game.

### Implementation Details

1. Completed the `handleChordClick` function in `playerActionService.ts` which:
   - Validates game state and player status through the existing `validateAction` helper
   - Calls the domain logic `chordClick` function from `gridLogic.ts`
   - Handles both successful reveals and mine hit scenarios
   - Updates the game state using `gameStateService`
   - Notifies clients about state changes via `gameUpdateService`
   - Calculates score changes based on the scoring configuration

2. Created comprehensive test suite in `playerActionService.chordClick.test.ts` covering:
   - Successfully revealing multiple cells with chord click
   - Hitting a mine during chord click
   - Chord clicking with insufficient flags
   - Player lockout scenarios
   - Edge cases like non-existent games or players
   - Error handling during chord click operations

3. Renamed test files to follow consistent naming convention:
   - `playerActionService.test.ts` â†’ `playerActionService.revealTile.test.ts`
   - Maintains consistency with `playerActionService.flagTile.test.ts`
   - Makes the test suite structure more intuitive

### Test Results

All tests pass with excellent coverage:
- **98.33%** statement coverage
- **91.3%** branch coverage
- **100%** function coverage
- **98.26%** line coverage

### Summary

The implementation of `handleChordClick` completes the trio of core player actions (reveal, flag, chord) in the `PlayerActionService`. The function follows the same pattern as the other action handlers, validating player actions, updating game state, and sending appropriate notifications to clients. With comprehensive test coverage, we've ensured the implementation is robust and handles all expected scenarios correctly.
