# Session 17: MongoDB Integration

**NOTE: The original prompt for this session is not available.**

## Session Notes

In this session, we switched backend persistence from PostgreSQL to MongoDB to better support the infinite board state.

### Implementation Steps

- Added `SpatialHashGrid` class (`backend/src/spatialHashGrid.ts`) for in-memory sparse board state management
- Installed `mongodb` driver
- Created `db.ts` with MongoDB connection logic, document interfaces, and basic interaction functions:
  - save/load chunks
  - save/load game
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to replace the PostgreSQL service with MongoDB:
  - Updated environment variables
  - Updated volumes
- Modified `backend/server.ts` to connect to MongoDB on startup and disconnect gracefully on shutdown

### Next Steps

- Refactor backend types (`types.ts`)
- Update game logic (`game.ts`)
- Modify socket handlers (`socketHandlers.ts`) to use `SpatialHashGrid` and integrate database persistence

This session established the foundation for using MongoDB as our persistence layer, which better aligns with the sparse nature of our infinite minesweeper board.
