# Session 22: Sessions Refactoring & Organization

## Original Prompt

This major refactor could be considered session 22 no? lets create that session then commit all the changes.

## Session Notes

In this session, we performed a major reorganization of the project's session documentation to improve clarity and maintainability.

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Session Numbering Correction
- Fixed inconsistent session numbering in SESSIONS.md
- Corrected session references across all files to maintain consistent numbering
- Established a clear chronological order for all sessions

#### 2. Individual Session Files Creation
- Created dedicated files for each session in the `prompts/` directory
- Followed a consistent naming pattern: `SESSION_XX_Description.md`
- Added a note for sessions where the original prompt was not available

#### 3. File Structure Standardization
Each session file now follows a consistent structure:
- Begins with the original prompt (when available)
- Followed by comprehensive session notes
- Includes implementation details, key decisions, and outcomes

#### 4. SESSIONS.md Restructuring
- Transformed SESSIONS.md into a concise index of all sessions
- Added links to individual session files
- Included brief summaries for each session
- Maintained chronological order with proper dating

### Key Benefits

- Improved navigation through project history
- Better documentation of decision-making process
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Clear separation between prompt and implementation details
- More maintainable documentation structure

### Outcome

The project now has a well-organized documentation structure that clearly shows the evolution of the codebase through distinct development sessions, making it easier to understand how and why features were implemented.
