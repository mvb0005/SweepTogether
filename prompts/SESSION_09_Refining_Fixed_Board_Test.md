# Session 9: Refining Fixed Board Test

**NOTE: The original prompt for this session is not available.**

## Session Notes

In this session, we debugged and refined the `fixed_board.cy.js` test to ensure it correctly validates custom board configurations.

### CSS Assertion Fixes

- Corrected the assertion for CSS `grid-template-columns` to match the browser's computed value instead of the `repeat()` shorthand
- This ensured that our tests accurately validate the grid layout dimensions

### Backend Debugging

- Addressed an issue where the backend seemed to ignore the `initialBoard` configuration
- Added detailed logging to the `joinGame` handler to trace the usage of `pendingGameConfigs` map
- Confirmed that the correct board configuration was being loaded

### Test Enhancement

- Updated the test to use a larger 4x3 board to ensure the setup works with different dimensions
- This validates that our framework handles arbitrary board sizes

### Assertion Issue Resolution

- Resolved an assertion failure (`expected <div.cell.revealed.mines-1> to have class mine`) by:
  - Initially adjusting the `fixedBoard` data in the test (`adjacentMines: undefined` for mines)
  - Adding logging to the backend's `revealTile` handler (specifically the `gameOver` emission)
  - Ensured the backend correctly uses the `initialBoard` from `pendingGameConfigs` when creating the game state

This session improved the reliability of our fixed board tests, ensuring that the E2E testing framework can properly configure and validate custom board layouts.
