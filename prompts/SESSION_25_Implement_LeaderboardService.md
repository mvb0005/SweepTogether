# Session 25: Implement LeaderboardService

## Original Prompt

Adopt the Backend Developer persona from `/mnt/c/Users/mvb/code/Mines/agent_personas/backend_developer.md`.

**Context:** Review `/mnt/c/Users/mvb/code/Mines/AGENT_CONTEXT.md` and `/mnt/c/Users/mvb/code/Mines/SESSION_GUIDELINES.md`, focusing on sections related to architecture, key files, and database interactions. In previous sessions, we've implemented the `ScoreService` which centralizes score management for individual games. Now we need to create a global leaderboard system that tracks top players across all games.

**Background:** The multiplayer nature of our Minesweeper game needs a competitive element through leaderboards that persist beyond individual game sessions. Players should be able to see how they rank against others based on different metrics (highest score, most mines found, most games won, etc.). This feature will enhance engagement and provide a sense of achievement.

**Task:**
1. Create a new file `backend/src/application/leaderboardService.ts` to implement the `LeaderboardService` class
2. The service should:
   a. Track and update player rankings across multiple games
   b. Store leaderboard data in MongoDB for persistence
   c. Provide different leaderboard categories (e.g., all-time best scores, daily best, most mines found)
   d. Expose methods to query current leaderboard standings
   e. Integrate with the ScoreService to receive score updates
   f. Broadcast leaderboard updates to clients through the GameUpdateService
3. Create necessary MongoDB schemas and collections for leaderboard data
4. Implement API endpoints to retrieve leaderboard data

**Verification:**
1. Create a new test file at `backend/src/tests/unit/leaderboardService.test.ts` to test the new functionality
2. Ensure tests cover:
   - Updating leaderboard entries when scores change
   - Retrieving leaderboard data with different sorting/filtering criteria
   - Persistence of leaderboard data
   - Proper integration with ScoreService and GameUpdateService
3. Run the tests with coverage to ensure good test coverage of the new service
4. Implement appropriate error handling and edge case management

**Context Update:** Add a summary of the implementation to `SESSIONS.md` when complete, noting any design decisions or patterns used in the LeaderboardService implementation. Consider how this service might need to evolve if we implement user accounts in the future.

## Session Goals

Implement a LeaderboardService to track player rankings across multiple games, providing persistent leaderboards with different categories and metrics.

## Implementation Summary

In this session, we designed and implemented a LeaderboardService that tracks player performance across multiple game sessions. This service maintains different types of leaderboards and provides methods to query and update player rankings.

### Key components implemented:

1. **Leaderboard Data Model**:
   - Created enums for leaderboard categories (all-time, daily, weekly)
   - Created enums for tracking metrics (highest score, most mines found, most cells revealed, games won)
   - Defined interfaces for leaderboard entries, requests, and responses

2. **MongoDB Integration**:
   - Added a LeaderboardDocument interface for MongoDB storage
   - Created a leaderboards collection with appropriate indexes for performance
   - Implemented caching to minimize database access
   - Added database indexes for optimal query performance

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Connected the LeaderboardService to the existing event system
   - Subscribed to score updates and game over events to track player performance
   - Added socket events for leaderboard data requests and updates

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implemented caching of leaderboard data
   - Added efficient database indexing
   - Limited leaderboard size to prevent unbounded growth
   - Broadcast updates only when top entries are affected

5. **Testing**:
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for the LeaderboardService
   - Verified correct behavior across different metrics and categories

### File Changes:

1. **New Files**:
   - `backend/src/application/leaderboardService.ts` - The main LeaderboardService implementation
   - `backend/src/tests/unit/leaderboardService.test.ts` - Unit tests for the LeaderboardService

2. **Modified Files**:
   - `backend/src/domain/types.ts` - Added leaderboard types and interfaces
   - `backend/src/infrastructure/network/socketEvents.ts` - Added leaderboard-related events
   - `backend/src/infrastructure/persistence/db.ts` - Added leaderboard collection and indexes
   - `backend/src/application/services.ts` - Registered the LeaderboardService
   - `backend/src/application/gameUpdateService.ts` - Added broadcasting methods

## Technical Details

### LeaderboardService Features

1. **Multiple Leaderboard Categories**:
   - ALL_TIME: Permanent leaderboard tracking all-time best performances
   - DAILY: Resets daily to show best performances of the current day
   - WEEKLY: Resets weekly to show best performances of the current week

2. **Different Metrics Tracked**:
   - HIGHEST_SCORE: Players with the highest overall scores
   - MOST_MINES_FOUND: Players who found the most mines
   - MOST_CELLS_REVEALED: Players who revealed the most cells
   - MOST_GAMES_WON: Players who won the most games

3. **Data Management**:
   - Efficient MongoDB storage with proper indexing
   - In-memory cache to minimize database queries
   - Limited leaderboard size to prevent unbounded growth
   - Updates triggered by game events (score changes, game completions)

## Testing Approach

We created comprehensive unit tests to verify:

1. Event subscription works correctly
2. Proper initialization and cache management
3. Score updates affect the appropriate leaderboards
4. Leaderboard queries return correct and sorted data
5. Client requests are handled properly

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Integrating the LeaderboardService with the existing event system
   **Solution**: Added missing event types and subscribed to score and game over events

2. **Challenge**: Efficiently updating multiple leaderboards without excessive database operations
   **Solution**: Implemented an in-memory cache and batched leaderboard updates

3. **Challenge**: Organizing testing to properly mock MongoDB interactions
   **Solution**: Restructured test setup to properly mock the database module before use

## Next Steps

With the LeaderboardService now in place, potential next steps include:

1. Frontend components to display leaderboards
2. Authentication system to prevent spoofing of player identities
3. Additional leaderboard categories (monthly, yearly)
4. Player profile system to showcase achievements and stats
5. Automated data cleanup for time-based leaderboards
