# Session 12: Game Over Board Reveal

**NOTE: The original prompt for this session is not available.**

## Session Notes

In this session, we updated the game over logic to reveal the entire board instead of just the mines.

### Backend (`backend/src/server.ts`) Changes

- Modified the `revealTile` handler for enhanced game over experience
- In both the direct mine click and chord click mine reveal scenarios, updated the logic to iterate through the entire board and set `cell.revealed = true` for all cells
- Ensured the `gameOver` event emits the fully revealed board state, providing players with a complete picture of the game board

### E2E Tests Updates

- Updated the assertions in the `cypress/e2e/chord_click.cy.js` test ('should trigger game over if chord click reveals a mine')
- Added verification that *all* cells are revealed, not just the mines and the initially clicked/flagged cells

This enhancement provides a better user experience by showing the complete board state when a game ends, mimicking the behavior of traditional Minesweeper games.
