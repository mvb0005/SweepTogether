# Session 5: Debugging E2E Test Failures

**NOTE: The original prompt for this session is not available.**

## Session Notes

In this session, we investigated and fixed failures in the `game_updates.cy.js` E2E test, specifically the `should reveal a cell when clicked` test.

### Investigation Steps

- Increased Cypress timeouts in `game_updates.cy.js` (both in `beforeEach` and assertion waits) to rule out timing issues
- Identified a mismatch between the backend's emitted `gameState` (using key `board`) and the frontend's expectation (expecting `revealedBoard` and `boardConfig`)
- Modified `backend/src/server.ts` to emit `gameState` with the correct keys (`revealedBoard`, `boardConfig`)
- Identified that the frontend's `renderBoard` function in `script.js` was not correctly handling the `boolean[][]` structure of the `revealedBoard` sent by the backend
- Modified `frontend/script.js` to correctly interpret the boolean `revealedBoard` for setting `hidden`/`revealed` classes

### Further Debugging

- Observed a new test failure where the initial assertion `cy.get(...).should('have.class', 'hidden')` failed because the cell was already marked as `revealed`
- Added extensive `console.log` statements to both `backend/src/server.ts` and `frontend/script.js` to trace the `gameState` flow (initial emission, reception, updates after click)
- Set up interactive debugging using `npx cypress open` for checking browser/backend logs

This session highlighted the importance of ensuring consistency between frontend expectations and backend responses, as well as proper timing in asynchronous test assertions.
