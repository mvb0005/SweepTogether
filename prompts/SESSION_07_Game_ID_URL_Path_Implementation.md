# Session 7: Game ID via URL Path - Implementation & E2E Fixes

**NOTE: The original prompt for this session is not available.**

## Session Notes

In this session, we implemented a feature to use the URL path as a unique identifier for game instances, allowing multiple games and persistence via URL.

### Feature Breakdown

- The path segment after the root (e.g., `/game/my-cool-game`) serves as the `gameId`
- Accessing a URL with a `gameId` for the first time creates a new game associated with that ID
- Accessing the same URL later joins the existing game associated with that ID
- E2E tests generate descriptive, timestamped `gameId`s (e.g., `e2e-test-<specName>-<timestamp>`) and visit `/game/<gameId>`

### Backend (`backend/src/server.ts`) Changes

- Introduced `Map<string, GameState>` to store multiple game states
- Defined `GameState` interface
- Added `joinGame` event handler: Creates/joins game, adds socket to room, stores `gameId` on socket, emits initial state to joiner
- Modified `revealTile`, `flagTile`, `disconnect` handlers to use `socket.data.gameId`, retrieve correct `GameState`, and emit updates to the specific room (`io.to(gameId)`)
- Removed game state deletion logic from `revealTile` (on game over) and `disconnect` (on last player leaving) to ensure game persistence for a given URL path

### Frontend (`frontend/script.js`) Changes

- Added logic to parse `window.location.pathname` to get `gameId`
- Added code to emit `joinGame` with `gameId` after connection
- Added explicit Socket.IO connection URL: `const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');` to resolve connection issues

### E2E Tests Updates

- Updated tests to generate unique `gameId` in `beforeEach`
- Changed `cy.visit('/')` to `cy.visit(`/game/${gameId}`);`

### Nginx and HTML Configuration

- Verified `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;` for SPA routing in `frontend/nginx.conf`
- Refined config with a specific `location ~* \\.(?:css|js|...)$` block to handle static assets
- Updated `<link>` and `<script>` tags in `frontend/index.html` to use absolute paths (`/style.css`, `/script.js`) to fix 404 errors

### Build/Test Process Improvements

- Corrected `test:headless` script in `package.json` (removed invalid `--no-sandbox`, fixed `--headed` typo)
- Added backend CORS headers (`cors: { origin: "http://localhost:8080" }` in `server.ts`) to fix cross-origin issues
- Resolved various issues to get tests passing successfully
