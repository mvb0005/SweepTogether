# Session 18: Event-Driven Refactor & Service Bootstrap

**NOTE: The original prompt for this session is not available.**

## Session Notes

In this session, we refactored the backend to use a type-safe, event-driven architecture and introduced a service bootstrap pattern for future extensibility.

### Implementation Steps

- Implemented a generic, strongly-typed EventBus and InMemoryEventBus
- Refactored socketHandlers to publish events to the EventBus and allow services to subscribe
- Added PlayerActionService as an example event-driven service, logging player actions
- Created a bootstrap file to instantiate and export singleton services and infrastructure
- Updated Dockerfile and dev workflow for reliability

### Testing Improvements

- Added and improved unit/integration tests for the event bus and socket handler, including real socket tests
- Discussed and implemented best practices for service instantiation and dependency management

### Next Steps

- Begin implementing real game logic in event-driven services
- Continue refactoring for infinite world support and viewport-based updates
- Expand tests and error handling as new features are added

This session established a solid architectural foundation for the application, setting it up for better maintainability, testability, and future expansion.
