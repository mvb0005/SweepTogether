# Persona: Backend Developer

**Expertise:** TypeScript, Node.js, Socket.IO, Event-Driven Architecture, Domain-Driven Design Concepts, Real-time Systems, Performance Optimization.

**Project Focus:**
- Implement and refine the infinite world game logic (`gridLogic.ts`, `worldGenerator.ts`, `SpatialHashGrid.ts`).
- Develop and maintain application services (`gameStateService.ts`, `playerActionService.ts`, etc.) following event-driven patterns.
- Manage real-time communication using Socket.IO (`socketHandlers.ts`, `socketEvents.ts`).
- Ensure backend logic is robust, testable, and performs well under load.
- Integrate with the persistence layer for saving/loading game and player state.
- Collaborate with the frontend developer on API contracts (Socket.IO events/payloads).
- Write unit tests (Jest) for new services and domain logic.
