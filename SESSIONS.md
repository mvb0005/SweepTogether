## Session 17: [MongoDB Integration](./prompts/SESSION_17_MongoDB_Integration.md) (2025-05-01)
Switched from PostgreSQL to MongoDB for better infinite board state persistence.

## Session 18: [Event-Driven Refactor & Service Bootstrap](./prompts/SESSION_18_Event_Driven_Refactor.md) (2025-05-02)
Refactored backend to use a type-safe event-driven architecture with service bootstrap pattern.

## Session 19: [Refactor PlayerActionService for REVEAL_TILE](./prompts/SESSION_19_Refactor_PlayerActionService_REVEAL_TILE.md) (2025-05-02)
Updated the PlayerActionService to handle reveal actions using the infinite world logic.

## Session 20: [Unit Testing PlayerActionService](./prompts/SESSION_20_Unit_Testing_PlayerActionService.md) (2025-05-02)
Created comprehensive unit tests for the reveal tile functionality.

## Session 21: [Implement handleFlagTile in PlayerActionService](./prompts/SESSION_21_Implement_handleFlagTile.md) (2025-05-03)
Implemented flag functionality with scoring and unit tests, extracting common validation logic into helper functions.

## Session 22: [Sessions Refactoring & Organization](./prompts/SESSION_22_Sessions_Refactoring_Organization.md) (2025-05-03)
Reorganized project documentation with consistent session numbering, individual session files with standardized structure, and a concise session index.

## Session 23: [Implement handleChordClick](./prompts/SESSION_23_Implement_handleChordClick.md) (2025-05-02)
Implemented chord click functionality in PlayerActionService with comprehensive unit tests, completing the trio of core player actions (reveal, flag, chord) with excellent test coverage.

## Session 24: [Implement ScoreService](./prompts/SESSION_24_Implement_ScoreService.md) (2025-05-02)
Implemented a dedicated ScoreService to centralize game scoring logic. The service handles scoring for revealing cells, hitting mines, and flag operations (placing/removing). Updated PlayerActionService to delegate all score-related operations to ScoreService. Comprehensive unit tests were added to ensure proper integration between services.

## Session 25: [Implement LeaderboardService](./prompts/SESSION_25_Implement_LeaderboardService.md) (2025-05-02)
Implemented a LeaderboardService that tracks player rankings across multiple games. The service maintains leaderboards for different categories (all-time, daily, weekly) and metrics (highest score, most mines found, most cells revealed, games won). Added MongoDB persistence with efficient indexing and caching for performance optimization. Created comprehensive unit tests to verify the service's functionality.
