# Session Log

### Session: 2025-04-26 - 1 (Initial Requirements Clarification)

*   **Q:** What are the specific point values for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place on a mine reveal?
    *   **A:** Configurable per game with reasonable defaults.
*   **Q:** How many points are lost for clicking a mine?
    *   **A:** Configurable per game with reasonable defaults.
*   **Q:** What is the duration of the player lockout after an error?
    *   **A:** Configurable per game with reasonable defaults.
*   **Q:** What is the desired size of the Minesweeper board (rows, columns, number of mines)? Or should this be configurable?
    *   **A:** Configurable per game with reasonable defaults. Each game will have a "configuration" that is set with the rules at the time.
*   **Q:** Is there a maximum number of players allowed in a single game?
    *   **A:** No hard technical limit initially. May be revisited based on performance or matchmaking needs.
*   **Q:** How should games be started? Is there a lobby system, or do players join an ongoing global game?
    *   **A:** One global game running on the homepage that everyone joins. Players log in with a username for leaderboard/point tracking.
*   **Q:** Are there any specific visual or user experience elements you have in mind for the frontend?
    *   **A:** Modern, clean Minesweeper theme. Point drop animations on score gain. Real-time leaderboard displayed alongside the game, updating as scores change.
*   **Q:** Do you have a preference for a specific cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) or database (PostgreSQL is suggested, but others are possible)?
    *   **A:** No preference.

### Session: 2025-04-26 - 2 (Project Setup Discussion)

*   **Summary:** Completed the initial project setup phase as outlined in the High-Level Plan (Step 1).
*   **Specifics:**
    *   **Backend:**
        *   Initialized Node.js project (`backend/package.json`).
        *   Set up a basic Express server (`backend/server.js`).
        *   Integrated Socket.IO into the Express server.
        *   Created `backend/Dockerfile` for containerizing the Node.js application.
    *   **Frontend:**
        *   Created basic HTML (`frontend/index.html`), CSS (`frontend/style.css`), and JavaScript (`frontend/script.js`) files.
        *   Created `frontend/Dockerfile` (using a simple static server like `nginx` or `http-server`) to serve the frontend files.
        *   Added `frontend/nginx.conf` to proxy Socket.IO requests.
        *   Updated `frontend/Dockerfile` to use the custom `nginx.conf`.
    *   **Database:**
        *   Defined a PostgreSQL service within `docker-compose.yml`, including volume for data persistence.
    *   **Containerization & Orchestration:**
        *   Configured `docker-compose.yml` to define and link the `backend`, `frontend`, and `db` services.
        *   Ensured services can communicate over the Docker network.
        *   Verified that `docker-compose up --build` successfully builds images and starts all containers. Basic connectivity established (e.g., backend can theoretically connect to DB, frontend can be served).

### Session: 2025-04-26 - 3 (Core Game Logic Implementation)

*   **Summary:** Began implementing core server-side game logic in TypeScript.
*   **Specifics:**
    *   Refactored `backend/server.js` to `backend/src/server.ts`.
    *   Fixed initial syntax errors and compilation issues in `server.ts`.
    *   Converted CommonJS `require` statements to ES Module `import` statements.
    *   Added basic TypeScript type definitions for game entities (`Cell`, `Board`, `RevealedBoard`, `Player`, `Players`).
    *   Applied types to core game state variables (`board`, `revealedBoard`, `players`).
    *   Implemented the `generateBoard` function, including random mine placement and calculation of adjacent mine counts for each cell.
    *   Added basic server-side handling for the `revealTile` socket event, including:
        *   Input validation (checking boundaries, already revealed).
        *   Marking the tile as revealed.
        *   Basic game over logic (detecting if a mine was clicked).
        *   Broadcasting updated game state (`gameState`) or game over (`gameOver`) events.
    *   Added basic handling for player connection (`connection`) and disconnection (`disconnect`) events, managing the `players` object.
    *   Ensured Express app, HTTP server, and Socket.IO server are correctly initialized and typed.

### Session: 2025-04-26 - 4 (E2E Test Setup with Cypress)

*   **Summary:** Set up Cypress for End-to-End testing and resolved initial execution errors.
*   **Specifics:**
    *   Installed Cypress (`npm install --save-dev cypress`).
    *   Initialized npm in the root directory (`npm init -y`) as it was missing.
    *   Initialized Cypress (`npx cypress open`), creating `cypress.config.js` and the `cypress/` directory structure.
    *   Configured `baseUrl` in `cypress.config.js` to `http://localhost:8080` to match the frontend service exposed by Docker Compose.
    *   Created basic test specs (`cypress/e2e/app_loads.cy.js`, `cypress/e2e/game_updates.cy.js`).
    *   Ran tests (`npx cypress run`) and encountered `Cannot find module \'cypress\'` error due to missing root `package.json`. Resolved by running `npm init -y` and reinstalling Cypress.
    *   Ran tests again and encountered `ReferenceError: io is not defined` because Nginx wasn\'t proxying Socket.IO requests. Resolved by adding `frontend/nginx.conf` and updating `frontend/Dockerfile`.

### Session: 2025-04-26 - 5 (Debugging E2E Test Failures)

*   **Summary:** Investigated and attempted to fix failures in the `game_updates.cy.js` E2E test, specifically the `should reveal a cell when clicked` test.
*   **Specifics:**
    *   Increased Cypress timeouts in `game_updates.cy.js` (`beforeEach` and assertion waits) to rule out timing issues.
    *   Identified a mismatch between the backend\'s emitted `gameState` (using key `board`) and the frontend\'s expectation (expecting `revealedBoard` and `boardConfig`).
    *   Modified `backend/src/server.ts` to emit `gameState` with the correct keys (`revealedBoard`, `boardConfig`).
    *   Restarted the backend service.
    *   Identified that the frontend\'s `renderBoard` function in `script.js` was not correctly handling the `boolean[][]` structure of the `revealedBoard` sent by the backend.
    *   Modified `frontend/script.js` to correctly interpret the boolean `revealedBoard` for setting `hidden`/`revealed` classes.
    *   Observed a new test failure where the initial assertion `cy.get(...).should(\'have.class\', \'hidden\')` failed because the cell was already marked as `revealed`.
    *   Added extensive `console.log` statements to both `backend/src/server.ts` and `frontend/script.js` to trace the `gameState` flow (initial emission, reception, updates after click).
    *   Instructed on using `npx cypress open` for interactive debugging and checking browser/backend logs.

### Session: 2025-04-26 - 6 (Frontend Board Implementation Plan)

*   **Goal:** Implement the frontend rendering of the Minesweeper board based on detailed state received from the backend.
*   **Backend Changes Required:**
    *   Modify the `gameState` event emission in `backend/src/server.ts`.
    *   Instead of sending a `boolean[][]` for `revealedBoard`, send a `Cell[][]` structure.
    *   For revealed cells, send the full `Cell` object (`{ isMine, adjacentMines, revealed: true, flagged }`).
    *   For hidden cells, send a minimal representation like `{ revealed: false, flagged }` to avoid exposing mine locations prematurely.
*   **Frontend Changes Required (`frontend/script.js`):**
    *   Update the `socket.on(\'gameState\', ...)` handler to expect the new `Cell[][]` structure in `state.revealedBoard` (or rename the key if needed, e.g., `boardState`).
    *   Modify the `renderBoard` function:
        *   Accept the `Cell[][]` structure as input.
        *   Iterate through the cells.
        *   For each cell:
            *   If `cell.revealed` is `true`:
                *   Add the `revealed` class.
                *   If `cell.isMine` is `true`, add `mine` class and display \'ðŸ’£\'.
                *   If `cell.adjacentMines > 0`, add `mines-N` class and display the number.
                *   Otherwise (0 adjacent mines), leave the cell blank.
            *   If `cell.revealed` is `false`:
                *   Add the `hidden` class.
                *   If `cell.flagged` is `true`, add `flagged` class and display \'ðŸš©\' (Requires flag implementation later).
            *   Ensure click/contextmenu listeners are correctly attached and check the `revealed` status before emitting events.

### Session: 2025-04-26 - 7 (Game ID via URL Path - Implementation & E2E Fixes)

*   **Goal:** Use the URL path as a unique identifier for game instances, allowing multiple games and persistence via URL.
*   **Feature Breakdown:**
    *   The path segment after the root (e.g., `/game/my-cool-game`) will be the `gameId`.
    *   Accessing a URL with a `gameId` for the first time creates a new game associated with that ID.
    *   Accessing the same URL later joins the existing game associated with that ID.
    *   E2E tests will generate descriptive, timestamped `gameId`s (e.g., `e2e-test-<specName>-<timestamp>`) and visit `/game/<gameId>`.
*   **Implementation & Debugging Summary:**
    *   **Backend (`backend/src/server.ts`):**
        *   Introduced `Map<string, GameState>` to store multiple game states.
        *   Defined `GameState` interface.
        *   Added `joinGame` event handler: Creates/joins game, adds socket to room, stores `gameId` on socket, emits initial state to joiner.
        *   Modified `revealTile`, `flagTile`, `disconnect` handlers to use `socket.data.gameId`, retrieve correct `GameState`, and emit updates to the specific room (`io.to(gameId)`).
        *   Removed game state deletion logic from `revealTile` (on game over) and `disconnect` (on last player leaving) to ensure game persistence for a given URL path, as requested.
    *   **Frontend (`frontend/script.js`):**
        *   *(Planned)* Parse `window.location.pathname` to get `gameId`.
        *   *(Planned)* Emit `joinGame` with `gameId` after connection.
        *   *(Fix)* Explicitly set Socket.IO connection URL: `const socket = io(\'http://localhost:3000\');` to resolve connection issues.
    *   **E2E Tests (`cypress/e2e/*.cy.js`):**
        *   *(Planned)* Generate unique `gameId` in `beforeEach`.
        *   *(Planned)* Update `cy.visit(\'/\')` to `cy.visit(`/game/${gameId}`);`.
    *   **Nginx (`frontend/nginx.conf`):**
        *   Verified `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;` for SPA routing.
        *   Refined config with a specific `location ~* \\\\.(?:css|js|...)$` block to explicitly handle static assets and prevent `try_files` interference.
    *   **HTML (`frontend/index.html`):**
        *   Updated `<link rel=\"stylesheet\">` and `<script src=\"script.js\">` to use absolute paths (`/style.css`, `/script.js`) to fix 404 errors when visiting `/game/<gameId>` paths.
    *   **Build/Test Process:**
        *   Corrected `test:headless` script in `package.json` (removed invalid `--no-sandbox`, fixed `--headed` typo).
        *   Ran E2E tests (`npm run test:headless`).
        *   Diagnosed and fixed `SyntaxError: Unexpected token \'<\'` by addressing Nginx static file serving and adding backend CORS headers (`cors: { origin: \"http://localhost:8080\" }` in `server.ts`).
        *   Diagnosed and fixed 404 errors for CSS/JS by using absolute paths in `index.html`.\
        *   Final tests passed successfully.

### Session: 2025-04-26 - 8 (E2E Test Game Specification & Setup Framework - Implementation)

*   **Goal:** Enhance E2E tests to allow specifying the target game instance via `gameId` and provide a framework for setting up specific game configurations or states before tests run.
*   **Implementation Summary:**
    *   **Backend (`backend/src/server.ts`):**
        *   Added a new HTTP `POST /configure/:gameId` endpoint.
        *   This endpoint accepts `gameId` in the URL path and a JSON body like `{ \\\"config\\\": { \\\"rows\\\": R, \\\"cols\\\": C, \\\"mines\\\": M }, \\\"initialBoard\\\": [...] }`.
        *   The received configuration (including the optional `initialBoard`) is stored temporarily in a `pendingGameConfigs` map, keyed by `gameId`.
        *   Modified the `joinGame` socket handler: When creating a new game state (if `games.get(gameId)` is null), it checks `pendingGameConfigs` for the `gameId`.
        *   If a pending config exists, it\'s used to create the game (using `initialBoard` if provided, otherwise generating a board with the specified dimensions/mines). The pending config is then removed from the map.
        *   If no pending config exists, the default generation logic is used.
    *   **E2E Support (`cypress/support/commands.js`):**
        *   Created a new custom command: `cy.setupGame(gameId, config)`.
        *   The command accepts a `gameId` and a `config` object (which can include `rows`, `cols`, `mines`, and optionally `initialBoard`).
        *   It sends a `POST` request to the `/configure/:gameId` backend endpoint with the structured payload (`{ config: {...}, initialBoard: [...] }`).
        *   After the request successfully completes (status 200), it visits the game page using `cy.visit(\\`/game/\\${gameId}\\`)`.
    *   **E2E Tests (`cypress/e2e/*.cy.js`):**
        *   Updated `game_config.cy.js` to use `cy.setupGame` to define board dimensions before visiting.
        *   Created `fixed_board.cy.js` which uses `cy.setupGame` to provide a specific `initialBoard` layout along with dimensions/mines.
        *   Tests now generate unique `gameId`s for each run.
*   **Outcome:** E2E tests can now reliably set up specific game configurations (dimensions, mine count, or even exact board layouts) before interacting with the frontend, enabling more controlled and predictable testing scenarios.

### Session: 2025-04-26 - 9 (Refining Fixed Board Test)

*   **Summary:** Debugged and refined the `fixed_board.cy.js` test.
*   **Specifics:**
    *   Corrected the assertion for CSS `grid-template-columns` to match the browser\'s computed value instead of the `repeat()` shorthand.
    *   Addressed an issue where the backend seemed to ignore the `initialBoard` by adding detailed logging to the `joinGame` handler to trace the usage of `pendingGameConfigs`.
    *   Updated the test to use a larger 4x3 board to ensure the setup works with different dimensions.
    *   Resolved an assertion failure (`expected <div.cell.revealed.mines-1> to have class mine`) by:
        *   Initially adjusting the `fixedBoard` data in the test (`adjacentMines: undefined` for mines).
        *   Adding logging to the backend\'s `revealTile` handler (specifically the `gameOver` emission) to inspect the data being sent to the client for the mine cell.
        *   (Implicitly confirmed through subsequent successful tests) Ensured the backend correctly uses the `initialBoard` from `pendingGameConfigs` when creating the game state in the `joinGame` handler.

### Session: 2025-04-27 - 10 (Debugging E2E Test Failures - Round 2)

*   **Summary:** Addressed remaining E2E test failures in `fixed_board.cy.js` and `game_updates.cy.js`.
*   **Specifics:**
    *   **Backend (`backend/src/server.ts`):**
        *   Identified that `adjacentMines` might not be calculated correctly when using an `initialBoard` provided by tests, leading to incorrect state on game over in `fixed_board.cy.js`.
        *   Added a `calculateAdjacentMines` helper function.
        *   Ensured `calculateAdjacentMines` is called in `joinGame` both when generating a random board and when using a provided `initialBoard`.
        *   Identified redundant `gameState` broadcast in `joinGame` (once to joiner, once to room) potentially causing issues or timeouts in `game_updates.cy.js`.
        *   Simplified `joinGame` broadcasting: Emit full `gameState` only to the joining socket, emit a simpler `playerUpdate` event (just the player list) to the rest of the room.
    *   **Frontend (`frontend/script.js`):**
        *   Diagnosed `TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting \'innerHTML\')` in the browser console during test runs.
        *   Corrected `getElementById` call to use `\'leaderboard\'` instead of the old `\'scores\'` ID.
        *   Modified `updateLeaderboard` function to correctly target the `<ul>` element *within* the `#leaderboard` div.
        *   Added a socket listener for the new `playerUpdate` event to ensure the leaderboard updates when players join/leave.
*   **Outcome:** After applying backend logic fixes for `initialBoard` handling and broadcasting, and frontend fixes for leaderboard element selection and event handling, all E2E tests passed successfully.

### Session: 2025-04-27 - 11 (Flood Fill & Chord Click Implementation)

*   **Summary:** Implemented the \"Flood Fill\" and \"Chord Click\" core gameplay mechanics and added corresponding E2E tests.
*   **Specifics:**
    *   **Backend (`backend/src/server.ts`):**
        *   Implemented the `floodFill` function: Recursively reveals adjacent empty cells when a cell with 0 adjacent mines is revealed.
        *   Integrated `floodFill` logic into the `revealTile` handler.
        *   Implemented `handleChordClick` logic: When a revealed number cell is clicked and the number of adjacent flags matches the cell\'s number, reveal adjacent hidden, non-flagged cells.
        *   Integrated `handleChordClick` logic into the `revealTile` handler.
        *   Ensured both mechanics correctly handle game over conditions (e.g., chord click revealing a mine).
        *   Updated the `gameState` emission to include all newly revealed cells from these actions.
    *   **Frontend (`frontend/script.js`):**
        *   No major changes required, as the existing `renderBoard` function correctly displays the updated `gameState` received after flood fill or chord click actions on the backend.
    *   **E2E Tests:**
        *   Created `cypress/e2e/flood_fill.cy.js` to test the flood fill behavior.
        *   Created `cypress/e2e/chord_click.cy.js` to test the chord click behavior (including success, no-op, and game over scenarios).
        *   Updated the E2E test list in `TODO.md`.
    *   **TODO.md:**
        *   Marked \"Flood Fill\" and \"Chord Click\" features as implemented in the \"Core Gameplay Features\" section.
        *   Added the new E2E test files to the \"E2E Tests\" section.

### Session: 2025-04-27 - 12 (Game Over Board Reveal)

*   **Summary:** Updated the game over logic to reveal the entire board instead of just the mines.
*   **Specifics:**
    *   **Backend (`backend/src/server.ts`):**
        *   Modified the `revealTile` handler.
        *   In both the direct mine click and chord click mine reveal scenarios, updated the logic to iterate through the entire board and set `cell.revealed = true` for all cells.
        *   Ensured the `gameOver` event emits the fully revealed board state.
    *   **E2E Tests (`cypress/e2e/chord_click.cy.js`):**
        *   Updated the assertions in the \'should trigger game over if chord click reveals a mine\' test to verify that *all* cells are revealed, not just the mines and the initially clicked/flagged cells.

### Session: 2025-04-27 - 13 (Refactoring for Modularity and Documentation)

*   **Summary:** Refactored the codebase for better modularity and improved documentation.
*   **Specifics:**
    *   **Backend:**
        *   Created modular TypeScript files:
            *   `types.ts`: Moved all shared interfaces and types with detailed TSDoc comments.
            *   `board.ts`: Extracted board creation and management functions.
            *   `game.ts`: Moved core game logic including flood fill, reveal actions, and win condition checking.
            *   `socketHandlers.ts`: Separated WebSocket event handlers and communication logic.
            *   `server.ts`: Simplified as the entry point that sets up Express and Socket.IO.
        *   Added thorough TSDoc comments to all functions and interfaces.
        *   Fixed a bug in the game over message format (added "Game Over!" prefix to mine hit messages).
    *   **Frontend:**
        *   Restructured to use ES modules:
            *   `ui.js`: DOM manipulation and rendering functions.
            *   `network.js`: WebSocket communication layer.
            *   `gameClient.js`: Game state management and logic.
            *   `main.js`: Entry point that initializes the game.
        *   Updated `index.html` to use modules with `type="module"`.
        *   Added comprehensive JSDoc comments throughout the frontend code.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   Better separation of concerns.
        *   Improved code organization and maintainability.
        *   Enhanced documentation for future development.
        *   Easier identification and resolution of bugs.

### Session: 2025-04-27 - 14 (Debugging Scoring System Test)

*   **Summary:** Fixed a failing test in the `scoring_system.cy.js` file related to how points are awarded for revealing cells.
*   **Specifics:**
    *   Identified the issue in the `scoring_system.cy.js` test where it expected points to increase when clicking on already revealed cells.
    *   Analyzed the test's expectations and the current implementation of the scoring system.
    *   Determined that the issue was in the test itself rather than the backend implementation, which correctly only awards points for newly revealed cells.
    *   Modified the test to click on cell [1,3] for the second click instead of [1,0], as [1,3] would be a numbered cell that wasn't already revealed by the first click's flood fill.
    *   The fix ensures that each click in the test reveals a new numbered cell, properly testing the scoring system without changing the backend behavior.

## Session 2025-04-30: Frontend Migration to React

*   **Goal:** Replace the vanilla JS frontend with a React application using Vite and TypeScript.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Initialized a new React project within the `frontend` directory using Vite.
    *   Created a basic WebSocket connection hook (`useSocket`).
    *   Developed `Cell` and `Board` components to render the game grid.
    *   Refactored `App.tsx` to manage game state (board, players, etc.) received via WebSocket.
    *   Implemented handlers for `revealTile` and `flagTile` actions, sending events to the backend.
    *   Configured Nginx (`nginx/nginx.conf`) to support SPA routing (e.g., `/game/{gameId}`).
    *   Updated `App.tsx` to extract `gameId` from the URL path.
    *   Debugged and fixed the backend `handleJoinGame` function to emit the correct `gameJoined` event and payload structure expected by the React frontend.
*   **Outcome:** The frontend now renders the basic Minesweeper board using React, connects to the backend, and receives the initial game state. Basic interaction placeholders are present.
*   **Next Steps:** Add CSS styling, implement PlayerList and Leaderboard components, refine event handling.
