I want these "integration tests" to act like players playing the game. They should be able to play the game and make moves, just like a human player would. The tests should be able to interact with the game, make decisions based on the game state, and report the results of their actions. This will help ensure that the game is functioning correctly and that all features are working as expected. Think of "integration tests" as a euphemism for "players" in this context. The goal is to create a robust testing framework that can simulate real player behavior and validate the game's functionality. I would like to implement this in a way where the solution can automate playing the game efficiently enough to run maximum players at a time. The tests should be able to run in parallel and be able to handle multiple game sessions simultaneously. This will help ensure that the game can handle a large number of players and that the game mechanics are functioning correctly under load. The tests should also be able to report any issues or bugs that they encounter during gameplay, so that they can be addressed quickly and efficiently. Overall, the goal is to create a comprehensive testing framework that can simulate real player behavior and validate the game's functionality in a way that is efficient, effective, and scalable.

There is no need to use js for this.
